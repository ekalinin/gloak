// denominator comes from Keycloak's own OpenAPI description rather than from
// this list, so every case here names the operation it exercises - see
// Case.Operation and TestAdminCasesNameARealOperation.
//
// Several cases may exercise one operation: a success, a 404, a 403. The
// coverage report counts distinct operations, so writing more of them raises
// confidence without inflating the meter.
